        <h1 class="mt-5">Project 2</h1>
        <p class="lead">Our team is working again on behalf of Forestview and their second wave of SafetyZone&copy proposals to key customers.</p>
        <p class="pitch">For this project, we were tasked with creating an application that simulated the user interface for a business of our choice. 
            We decided to create the UI for employees at a hotel front desk and concierge with the following criteria:</p>
        <ul class="reqs">
             <li>Using Python3, create a 'robust' application that simulates a business' user interface.</li>
             <li>Use a GUI to allow user to fulfill the proposed duties of the application.</li>
             <li>Store, collect, and searche data sets using Json files to simulate inventory.</li>
             <li>Use Doc strings throughout for readability of the code.</li>
             <li>Package the application to an executable that users can download from this webpage (after signing the user agreement).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="specs">As before, we chose tkinter and Pylint as the required libraries.</p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4">Specifics</h3>
        <p class="specs">Our application simulates a hotel front desk, and includes the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul class="functions">
            <li>Guest check in and check out - with room availability visualized for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Room service - from both in-house kitchen and front desk pantry.</li>
            <li>Recipe Builder - easy to add new recipes to the menu</li>
            <li>Guest lookup - search for guests by name</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">We strive to provide quality service, and scalable, cyber-secure solutions.</p>
